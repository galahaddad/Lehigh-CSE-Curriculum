Part 1, SQL Excercise

(a) insert into department values (’History’,’Drown’,99999);

    When this command is used, a new insertion will be made into the destination table department. 
    It suceeds because the DDL command matches the requirements and the database table takes in 3 varchars.

(b)  insert into instructor values (12345,’Cygane’,’Economics’,256000);

    This command is used correctly aswell, meeting the command syntax and the table column syntax.

(c) delete student;

    delete is used to delete members of a table and requires the syntax: DELETE FROM [Table_Name] WHERE Condition
    In order to remove a table, you must use the drop command.
    What this command is doing is removing table values, but maintaining its structure, attributes, and indicies.

(d) delete department;

    Department is also a table, and as such cannot be removed using delete. Drop must be used to remove tables.
    What this command is doing is removing table values, but maintaining its structure, attributes, and indicies.

(e) delete course where course_id = 996;

    This syntax is not correct, as from is missing from the statement. 
    The correct syntax would be DELETE FROM course WHERE course_id = 996;
